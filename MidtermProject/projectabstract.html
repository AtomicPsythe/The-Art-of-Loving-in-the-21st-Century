            <h2>Project Breakdown</h2>
            <p class="bodytext">The Art of Loving in the 21st Century is an interactive website that explores the 8 classical Greek forms of love through narrative design, color symbolism, and user-driven interaction. In today's day and age,  romantic love is often centered and idealized. As a result, this project aims to expand the conversation surrounding love by highlighting the many ways love is given, received, and practiced in everyday life. Drawing inspiration from contemporary reflections on love in the 21st century, this website reframes love not only as a feeling but as an action rooted in intention, awareness, and self-understanding.</p>

            <p class="bodytext">From the intensity of passion to the steadiness of long-term commitment, from friendship and familial bonds to self-compassion and universal empathy, each form of love is presented as equally significant. The interactive components encourage active reflection, inviting users to consider how they express love and how they allow themselves to receive it.</p>

            <p class="bodytext">Through its immersive design and emotional pacing, The Art of Loving in the 21st Century challenges the hierarchy that prioritizes romance above all else. Instead, it proposes that love is multifaceted and that self-love serves as the foundation from which all other connections grow.</p>
