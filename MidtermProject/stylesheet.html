            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p class="bodytextstylesheet">The typography sets the emotional tone of the website, as it is usually the first thing that is seen. The primary typeface, Cormorand Upright, was chosen as it is clean and legible across, therefore being used for the body text and navigation. A secondary typeface may be used, being Sparkling Valentine and Salon du Chocolat respectively, may be used for titles or accent text for contrast and personality.</p>

            <h2>Drawn Images</h2>
            <p class="bodytextstylesheet">While most images for websites can be taken from the Internet, sometimes creatives have a specific idea in mind for an image. The idea for drawing the love constellation was inspired by how constellations connect distant stars together to create meaning. Therefore, by mapping love as a constellation, the concept transforms abstract emotions into something navigable and interconnected, resonating with the values of The Art of Loving in the 21st Century. The character icon, while is a simple illustration, can be used and repeated across multiple pages, acting like a recurring character of sorts. Together these images create visual continuity across each page.</p>

            <h2>Color Palettes</h2>
            <p class="bodytextstylesheet">Color plays a crucial role in a website, as it creates a core identity for each page. Each love type is assigned its own color palette, allowing its respective content to feel distinct while still cohesive within the main color scheme (dark shade, lighter shade, white/pale shade). The base palette grounds the site with its neutral and complementary tones, being mostly rosey pinks and reds, allowing for there to be a strong base foundational palette that can be adjusted for each love type.</p>

            <h2>Website Inspirations</h2>
            <p class="bodytextstylesheet">When creating a website, it is important to draw inspiration from other existing websites. For The Art of Loving in the 21st Century, that was done threefold.</p>
            <h3>Design Inspiration: Fooror</h3>
            <p class="bodytextstylesheet">The <a href="https://fooror.com/" target="_blank">Fooror</a> website was a factored inspiration when it came to The Art of Loving in the 21st Century's design. The use of minimalist character design across various pages inspired the idea to include similarly designed minimalist characters across all pages for the interactive elements to feel more engaging. Additionally, its cohesive gradient color palette brought about the idea to utilize a gradient color palette for the backgrounds of each page. Lastly, the use of a standout title font to contrast that of the body typeface influenced me to consider using an alternative font for the titles of each page, more information on this can be found in the typography section.</p>

            <h3>Content Inspiration: The Anatomy of Love</h3>
            <p class="bodytextstylesheet">The <a href="https://theanatomyoflove.com/" target="_blank">Anatomy of Love</a> website was one of the primary catalysts when it came to creating this website. From the way it tackles the idea of love, to how the information is distributed, to showing real results and data, this website is great learning about the scientific aspect about love. I have always been intrigued about the idea of love and that it is multifaceted in how we possess it and how it can be expressed. From this, I was led to the <a href="https://theanatomyoflove.com/" target="_blank">Anatomy of Love</a> website, which ignited the idea to create a website that was similar in concept, but discussed a different perspective on love.</p>

            <h3>Interaction Inspiration: Quanta Magazine</h3>
            <p class="bodytextstylesheet">The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-we-came-to-know-earth-20250915/" target="_blank">Quanta Magazine</a> website utilizes some unique animations and interactions that I would also like to adopt within The Art of Loving in the 21st Century. For instance, I would like to adapt how the text at the beginning of the page fades in and out one line at a time to The Art of Loving in the 21st Century's home page as it follows a similar composition and would allow for a smoother and more welcoming introduction. In that same vein, Quanta Magazine has the text centered on their page with an image in the background, which then fades into having the image centered and the text on each side of it. This can be a potential interactive element that can be included in some or all pages, to create a cohesive flow of information and imagery. Lastly, the navigation bar and footer are very minimaly designed, which allows the main content to shine, something that I will also be including in my website.</p>

            <h2>Sample Images</h2>
            <p class="bodytextstylesheet">The use of sample imagery demonstrates how already created illustrations and visuals can help form a coherent identity across pages. The images that have been chosen have been either slightly edited and or cropped in oreder to match the established color palette and aesthetic and  to allow flexibility across layouts. These examples help define the visual tone and ensure that all imagery supports the emotional and thematic direction of the website.</p>
